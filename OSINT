Open-source intelligence â€“ OSINT 
Open-Source Intelligence is a valuable discipline in the realm of information gathering and analysis. OSINT refers to the collection, analysis, and utilization of publicly available information from various sources, such as the internet, social media, news outlets, public records, and more. This information can be used to gain insights, identify patterns, and make informed decisions in various fields, including national security, business, cybersecurity, journalism, and even personal safety. 
It plays a pivotal role in the field of social engineering, which is the art of manipulating individuals or organizations into revealing confidential information or taking certain actions. OSINT is used by attackers to gather valuable information about their targets, enabling them to craft more convincing and successful social engineering attacks.
Here's how OSINT contributes to social engineering:
1.	Target Profiling: OSINT allows attackers to create detailed profiles of their targets. This includes personal information, work history, hobbies, interests, and even emotional triggers. Such profiles enable attackers to tailor their social engineering tactics to match the preferences and vulnerabilities of the target.
2.	Phishing and Spear Phishing: Attackers use OSINT to craft convincing phishing emails or messages that appear legitimate. By knowing a target's interests, job role, or recent activities, attackers can create messages that seem relevant and trustworthy. This increases the likelihood of the target clicking on malicious links or sharing sensitive information.
3.	Impersonation: OSINT helps attackers impersonate trusted entities or individuals. By researching a target's network, they can identify friends, colleagues, or superiors and use that information to pose as someone the target knows and trusts.
4.	Contextual Manipulation: Attackers can use OSINT to gain insights into the target's current circumstances. This enables them to create social engineering scenarios that are highly relevant. For example, understanding that a target is currently involved in a major project, an attacker might craft a scenario related to that project to increase the chances of success.
5.	Physical Reconnaissance: In the context of physical security and on-site social engineering, OSINT helps attackers gather information about a target's workplace, access control systems, and the security personnel in place. This information is valuable for planning in-person attacks.
6.	Pretext Development: OSINT assists attackers in crafting believable pretexts for social engineering attacks. By understanding the target's preferences, routines, and the context of their daily life, attackers can design convincing stories or reasons to interact with the target.
7.	Exploiting Trust Networks: OSINT allows attackers to identify connections and trust relationships within a target's network. This knowledge can be used to exploit the trust that the target places in their associates, making it easier to manipulate them.
Here are some free OSINT tools that one can experiment with: 
1. theHarvester:
   - Description: theHarvester is an open-source tool designed for gathering email addresses, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports, and banners from different public sources. It's a valuable tool for reconnaissance and profiling during OSINT activities.
   - Usage: Security professionals, penetration testers, and OSINT practitioners use theHarvester to discover potential targets and identify vulnerabilities.
   - Key Features: theHarvester supports multiple data sources, such as search engines, social media, and public databases. It allows users to gather data based on a specified domain name, organization, or individual, helping to paint a comprehensive picture of a target.
2. Shodan:
